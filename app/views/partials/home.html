            <li><p>
                It quickly checks if it is possible for you to take a set of courses. <br>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                It returns to you the set of indexes if it is possible. <br>
                The check is done based on courses' time slot and exam date.</p></li>
            <li><p>
                It shows hidden indexes that aren't shown up in STARS Planner and you might be able to appeal for.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-center">What it DOES NOT</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>It doesn't register the course for you. 
            You still have to go to STARS Planner and register your courses in STARS. </p></li>
            <li><p>It doesn't guarantee you can take the course if you don't meet the course's pre-requisition. We don't have that data of you.</p></li>
            <li><p>It doesn't spam NTU server to get you more chances to get some course, because that's

            <li><p>It doesn't send a single HTTP request to NTU server. All requests are sent

        <h2 class="text-center">NTU's Policy</h2>
        <p>The following is a part of NTU's <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Students/Undergraduate/AcademicServices/CourseRegistration/Pages/Policies,RulesRegulations.aspx">
        Policies, Rules & Regulations</a> of course registration: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>... <br>Additionally, the use of an unauthorised computer program to gain 
            an unfair advantage over the rest of the students in securing courses 
            is also prohibited. <strong> The use of such programs places unnecessary load on 
            the University registration system already supporting a heavy traffic. 
            Rampant use could hang the system and cause major disruption to the 
            course registration exercise. </strong>
            <br><br>
            It is important that NTU students conduct themselves at all times in a 
            manner that is befitting of students and worthy of the good name of the University.
            <br><br>
            If you are found to have undertaken any of the above prohibited acts, 
            the University will de-register all electives (GER PE/UE) that are 
            in your registration records for the semester concerned. 
            This would be regardless of whether you have registered the 
            electives on your own, with the help of the School, 
            through the allocation system or appeal system. 
            In addition, you will be given a low priority in 
            the next allocation of electives. 
            The University will also not hesitate to take other necessary 
            disciplinary actions against such conduct...
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="text-center">So is this allowed?</h2>
        <p>For short, we don't guarantee anything, yet. However, the app is being sent for NTU's approval. The result
        is expected to be bright, because</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>It isn't unfair to use this tool, for anyone can use it.</p></li>
            <li><p>The app doesn't add any additional load to NTU server, not a single request is sent 
            to NTU's server. This can be monitored using browser dev tool by clicking F12 -> Network inside your browser.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>In consequence, it even <strong>decrease the load for NTU server</strong> because most of the
            try & false work is done in this application's environment rather than STARS Planner.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can try using this application at your own risk, we will soon update the approval status as soon as we hear from school.</p>
